/*

LXC (LinuX Containers) is an operating systemâ€“level virtualization method for running multiple isolated Linux systems (containers) on a single control host.

The Linux kernel comprises cgroups for resource isolation (CPU, memory, block I/O, network, etc.) that does not require starting any virtual machines. Cgroups also provides namespace isolation to completely isolate application's view of the operating environment, including process trees, network, user ids and mounted file systems.

LXC combines cgroups and namespace support to provide an isolated environment for applications.
